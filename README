== Hoozair

Hoozair is an inefficient and naive javascript chat client.  Its ideal use would be to installed on a linux box,  form all business concerns, and to allow users in the same 'channel' to chat with each other.

In a web application that doesn't employ any sort of locking strategy, it might be useful to know when other users are viewing the same record.


== Installation

1. Install Hoozair.
2. Link to /javascripts/application.js in your application.  (Also reference jQuery if you're not already)
3. new up an instance of the chat client:

  var hoozair = new Hoozair(username, channel, domain, target)
  
  username - the username of the current user
  channel  - possibly the page name or record id of the item being viewed
  domain   - 'http://localhost:3000' when developing locally
  target   - the target html element to put the user_list div in.  if none is provided, it defaults to body

== TODO
* timeout due to inactivity 
* show idle status
* allow messaging
